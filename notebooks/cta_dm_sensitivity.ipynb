      "We describe a methodology for the calculation of experimental sensitivity for CTA DM searches that follows the approach described in <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1007.1727\">Cowan et al. 2010</a>.  The basic idea is to construct a representative data set (the \"Asimov\" data set) and apply a maximum likelihood analysis to this data set in the same way we would for the real data.\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to formulate the sensitivity calculation for CTA we first construct a DM test statistic (TS) which is the statistical test we apply to the data to search for a DM signal.  The method of maximum likelihood (ML) is generally the most sensitive statistical test in the asymptotic limit (smallest variance) and thus should provide the best theoretical sensitivity for CTA analysis.  We formulate the TS from the likelihood ratio between two models with and without DM:\n",
      "\n",
      "$TS = 2\\left(\\ln L(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{1}|\\mathcal{D}) - \\ln L(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{0}|\\mathcal{D})\\right)$\n",
      "\n",
      "where $L(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}|\\mathcal{D})$ is the liklihood for the data $\\mathcal{D}$ under a set of parameters $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$.  The parameters $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{1}$ and $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{0}$ are the MLEs for the model parameters under the signal and null hypotheses respectively.  Note that the parameter set $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ can include any number of nuisance parameters.  The impact of  nuisance parameters on the signal sensitivity is accounted for by reoptimizing the likelihood as a function of all parameters for each trial value of the signal parameters."

      "In the case of CTA analysis of a DM target the likelihood can naturally be formulated in terms of the PDF for the data in three dimensions: two spatial coordinates (e.g. RA and DEC) and one energy coordinates.  Note that one could further consider formulating the likelihood with additional dimensions -- for instance the G/H parameter or parameters which correlate with the reconstruction quality (telescope multiplicity).  One advantage of the ML approach is that the contribution of data at a particular point in phase space will be automatically weighted according to the signal and background probabilities.  Thus as long as the ROI and energy range fully encompasses the signal there is no need to optimize additional parameters of the analysis.  This is to be compared to analyses which integrate the data over a given spatial region or energy range.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the CTA observation of a sphericaly symmetric DM halo we can make a simplification by taking advantage of the azimuthal symmetry of the DM signal with respect to the halo center and performing the analysis in only two dimensions: energy and radial distance from the source.  In doing this we implicitly assume that the background will also be azimuthally symmetric.  The data can then be represented in terms of a 2D array of bin occupation values where $\\mathcal{D} = \\{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{ij}\\}$ with $i$ denoting the energy bin index and $j$ denoting the radial bin index.  For each bin we evaluate the amplitude of signal and background based on the following performance parameters for the CTA array:\n",

      "Here we provide some specific formulae which can be used to evaluate the sensitivity for an on-off experiment.  In the following notation we use a single index (i) to indicate the vector of bin occupations ($n_{i}$).  We assume two normalization parameters for the signal and background distributions ($\\mu_{s}$ and $\\mu_{b}$) which are obtained by fitting to the data vector.  The normalization of the background is additionally constrained by the number of counts in a control (off) region ($n_{c}$).
